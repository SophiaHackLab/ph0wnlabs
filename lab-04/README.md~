In this session, you have a couple of CrackMe binaries. The goal of the session is to solve them using AI, either with Radare's R2AI plugin, or with GhidraMCP.

Please install [Exegol](https://github.com/ThePorgs/Exegol), which contain both Ghidra and Radare2. Alternatively, you may install manually [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra) and [Radare2](https://www.radare.org/n/radare2.html).

# Installing the AI components

## R2AI

Once Radare2 is installed on your system:

```
r2pm -ci r2ai decai
```

## GhidraMCP

Follow the [install instructions](https://github.com/LaurieWired/GhidraMCP)
